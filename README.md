## Description
This is my xkcd password generator.
It allows you to pick between 1-9 words for your password phrase.
It allows you pick from 3 possible separators (none, underscore, hyphen)
It allows you to select from 1-9 randomly selected special characters
It gives you the option of adding a random integer between 0-100 to the end of your password phrase.

Once you hit submit, the password phrase shows up on a new page, along with a button that allows you to return to the generator page.

## Details for teaching team

The word list was taken from : https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/blob/master/google-10000-english.txt
"The repo contains a list of the 10,000 most common English words in order of frequency, as determined by n-gram frequency analysis of the Google's Trillion Word Corpus."
Some of the passwords generated may not pass PG rating and/or be NSFW - that's ok though, you can always generate a new one.
