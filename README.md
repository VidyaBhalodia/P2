## Description
This is my xkcd password generator.
It allows you to pick between 1-9 words for your password phrase - default 4.
It allows you pick from 3 possible separators (none, underscore, hyphen) - default none.
It allows you to select from 0-9 randomly selected special characters - default 0.
It gives you the option of adding a random integer between 0-100 to the end of your password phrase. - default no.
- Validation : Client-side and Server-side validation is performed to ensure appropriate values for the number of words and the number of special characters. 
If an invalid value is sent to the server, an appropriate error message will be displayed - and the value will be set to an acceptable one. Then the password will be created based on the correct values. 

Once you hit submit, the password phrase shows up on a new page, along with a button that allows you to return to the generator page.

## Details for teaching team

The word list was taken from : https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/blob/master/google-10000-english.txt
"The repo contains a list of the 10,000 most common English words in order of frequency, as determined by n-gram frequency analysis of the Google's Trillion Word Corpus."
Some of the passwords generated may not pass PG rating and/or be NSFW - that's ok though, you can always generate a new one.
